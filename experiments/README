This directory contains scripts for testing and benchmarking the flash
proxy.

== Preparation

You need to have installed certain software before running the tests.
	Firefox 8.0.1
	socat
	Wget
	Python
	thttpd
	Flash Player
socat, Wget, and Python are easily installed on most GNU/Linux
distributions. thttpd can be compiled from the packages at
http://acme.com/software/thttpd/. A debug version of Flash Player can be
downloaded from http://www.adobe.com/support/flashplayer/downloads.html.

Firefox versions 9 and 10 will not work; these versions have a change to
the -no-remote option that prevents the tests from running. This is
supposed to be fixed in version 11.

You need to create some dedicated Firefox profiles. Create profiles
named flashexp1 and flashexp2 by running
	firefox -ProfileManager -no-remote
Start the browsers with
	firefox -P flashexp1 -no-remote &
	firefox -P flashexp2 -no-remote &
and in each one, set this about:config variable:
	browser.link.open_newwindow=1 (default is 3)
This allows the scripts to clear the contents of a tab and replace them
with another page.

Before running any tests, start the crossdomain server as root:
	sudo crossdomaind.py --daemon
The tests themselves shouldn't be run as root.

I personally run these tests in an Arch Linux VM.
	useradd -m user
	passwd user
	pacman -Sy
	pacman -Su
	pacman -S firefox socat python2 xorg xorg-xinit xterm flashplugin gcc make
Download thttpd, compile it (you have to rename the getline function to
avoid a naming conflict), and install it in /usr/local/bin. Symlink
/usr/bin/python to /usr/bin/python2. Also you have to install the
ttf-ms-fonts package from the AUR for text to show up in Flash Player.
Add a window manager, run "startx", and you should be set.
