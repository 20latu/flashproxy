Changes in version 0.8
  o The proxy badge does more intelligent parsing of the boolean "debug"
    parameter. "0", "false", and other values are now interpreted as
    false and do not activate debug mode. Formerly any non-empty value
    was interpreted as true. Fixes bug 7110. Patch by Alexandre Allaire.
