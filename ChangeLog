Changes in version 0.12
  o The new websocket-server program is the server transport plugin that
    flash proxies talk to. It replaces the third-party websockify
    program that was used formerly. It works as a managed proxy and
    supports the extended ORPort protocol. Fixes bug 7620.

  o Added a line of JavaScript that you can use to put a proxy badge on
    MediaWiki sites that allow custom JavaScript. Follow the
    instructions in modules/mediawiki/custom.js. Contributed by
    Sathyanarayanan Gunasekaran.

Changes in version 0.11
  o Added -4 and -6 options to flashproxy-client and
    flashproxy-reg-http. (The options already existed in
    flashproxy-reg-email.) These options cause registrations helpers to
    use IPv4 or IPv6 only. Fixes bug 7622. Patch by Jorge Couchet.

  o The facilitator now gives only IPv4 clients to proxies requesting
    over IPv4, and IPv6 clients to proxies requesting over IPv6. This is
    to avoid the situation where an IPv4-only proxy is given an IPv6
    address it cannot connect to. Fixes bug 6124. Patch by Jorge Couchet
    and David Fifield.

  o The proxy now accepts a cookierequired parameter that controls
    whether users have to explicitly state their desire to be a proxy.
    The page at http://crypto.stanford.edu/flashproxy/options.html
    allows changing user preference.

  o Proxies now poll for clients every 60 seconds rather than 10
    seconds, and do not begin to poll immediately upon beginning to run.

  o There are new alpha Tor Browser Bundles for download at
    https://people.torproject.org/~dcf/flashproxy/.

Changes in version 0.10
  o Fixed a bug in flashproxy-client that made it susceptible to a
    denial of service (program crash) when receiving large WebSocket
    messages made up of many small fragmented frames.

  o Made the facilitator hand out more proxies by default, reducing a
    client's need to re-register.

Changes in version 0.9
  o There are executable Windows packages of the client programs, so
    that the programs can be run without Python being installed. Fixes
    bug 7283. Alexandre Allaire and David Fifield.

  o There are now man pages for the client programs (flashproxy-client,
    flashproxy-reg-email, and flashproxy-reg-http). Fixes bug 6453.
    Alexandre Allaire.

  o The proxy now tries to determine whether it is running in Tor
    Browser, and disables itself if so. Fixes bug 6293. Patch by Jorge
    Couchet.

Changes in version 0.8
  o flashproxy-client now operates as a managed proxy by default. This
    means that there is no longer a need to start flashproxy-client
    separately from Tor. Use a "ClientTransportPlugin websocket exec"
    line as in the included torrc. To use flashproxy-client as an
    external proxy (the way it worked before), use the --external
    option. Fixes bug 7016.

  o The proxy badge does more intelligent parsing of the boolean "debug"
    parameter. "0", "false", and other values are now interpreted as
    false and do not activate debug mode. Formerly any non-empty value
    was interpreted as true. Fixes bug 7110. Patch by Alexandre Allaire.

  o Fixed a runtime error in flashproxy-client on Windows:
    AttributeError: 'module' object has no attribute 'IPPROTO_IPV6'
    Fixes bug 7147. Patch by Alexandre Allaire.

  o Fixed an exception that happened in Windows in flashproxy-reg-email
    in reading the trusted CA list. The exception message was:
      Failed to register: [Errno 185090050] _ssl.c:340: error:0B084002:x509 certificate routines:X509_load_cert_crl_file:system lib
    Fixes bug 7271. Patch by Alexandre Allaire.

  o Fixed an exception that happened on Windows in flashproxy-client,
    relating to the use of nonblocking sockets:
      Socket error writing to local: '[Errno 10035] A non-blocking socket operation could not be completed immediately'
    Fixed bug 7272. Patch by Alexandre Allaire.
