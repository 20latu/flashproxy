Changes in version 0.8
  o flashproxy-client now operates as a managed proxy by default. This
    means that there is no longer a need to start flashproxy-client
    separately from Tor. Use a "ClientTransportPlugin websocket exec"
    line as in the included torrc. To use flashproxy-client as an
    external proxy (the way it worked before), use the --external
    option.

  o The proxy badge does more intelligent parsing of the boolean "debug"
    parameter. "0", "false", and other values are now interpreted as
    false and do not activate debug mode. Formerly any non-empty value
    was interpreted as true. Fixes bug 7110. Patch by Alexandre Allaire.

  o Fixed a runtime error in flashproxy-client on Windows:
    AttributeError: 'module' object has no attribute 'IPPROTO_IPV6'
    Fixes bug 7147. Patch by Alexandre Allaire.

  o Fixed an exception that happened in Windows in flashproxy-reg-email
    in reading the trusted CA list. The exception message was:
      Failed to register: [Errno 185090050] _ssl.c:340: error:0B084002:x509 certificate routines:X509_load_cert_crl_file:system lib
    Fixes bug 7271. Patch by Alexandre Allaire.

  o Fixed an exception that happened on Windows in flashproxy-client,
    relating to the use of nonblocking sockets:
      Socket error writing to local: '[Errno 10035] A non-blocking socket operation could not be completed immediately'
    Fixed bug 7272. Patch by Alexandre Allaire.
