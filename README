Install the Flex SDK and put its bin directory in your PATH.

To build, run

$ make

Copy the swfcat.swf file to a web server.

Both the Tor client and the Tor relay (whose address is hardcoded in
swfcat.as) must serve a crossdomain policy in order to accept Flash
connections. The crossdomaind.py program does this.

On the client, set up a server to shuttle data between the Flash
connection and the local Tor. At the moment we use Ncat for this.

$ ncat -lv --max-conns 2 --broker 9001

Visit the swfcat.swf file in a web browser, appending the query string
"?client=X.X.X.X:9001", where X.X.X.X is the client address.

Then, start Tor on the client, with this configuration:

UseBridges 1
Bridge 127.0.0.1:9001

To start the facilitator on address ADDR and port PORT:
./facilitator.py ADDR PORT

Sending "POST" to the facilitator over TCP registers your address
and port (the ones you used to connect).

Sending "GET" gets an unserved client and sends it back formatted
as: "192.168.1.102:8888"
