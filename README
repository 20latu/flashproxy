== Introduction

This is a set of tools that make it possible to connect Tor through an
Adobe Flash proxy running on another computer. The Flash proxy can be
run just by opening a web page in a computer that has Flash Player
installed.

There are five main parts. Our terminology for each part is in quotes.
1. The Tor "client," running on someone's localhost.
2. A "connector," which waits for connections from the Flash proxy and
   the Tor client, and joins them together.
3. A Flash "proxy," running in someone's web browser. This piece is
   called swfcat because it is like a netcat implemented in Flash.
4. A "facilitator," a pseudo-HTTP server that keeps a list of clients
   that want a connection, and hands them out to proxies.
5. A Tor "relay," which is just a normal Tor relay except that its host
   must also serve a Flash crossdomain policy.

== Quick start

=== Building

Download the (free software) Flex SDK.
	http://opensource.adobe.com/wiki/display/flexsdk/Flex+SDK
Put its bin directory in your PATH. The important executable is mxmlc.

You need a Cirrus developer key from Adobe. Put it in the environment
variable CIRRUS_KEY so it can be found by Makefile.
	$ export CIRRUS_KEY=XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX-YYYYYYYYYYYY

To build, run
	$ make
Copy the resulting swfcat.swf file to a web server.

On the computer that will be the facilitator, run
	sudo ./crossdomaind.py
	./facilitator.py
crossdomaind.py needs to be run on any server that will accept
connections from a Flash proxy. It serves a chunk of data on port 843.
The facilitator runs on port 9002 by default.

The client needs to be running a version of Tor that supports the
Socks4Proxy configuration. This means version 0.2.2.1-alpha or
later--not the current stable release.

On the client, run
	./connector.py 127.0.0.1:9001 127.0.0.1:9002
Also on the client, open up the browser to swfcat.swf. Passing no
arguments should give you good defaults (expects the facilitator running
on Nate's server). swfcat will connect to the Cirrus server to
obtain a client ID which it then registers with the facilitator.

In a browser somewhere, open swfcat.swf and pass parameters telling it
which facilitator to use and to operate in proxy mode.
	http://www.example.com/swfcat.swf?proxy=true&facilitator=<FACILITATOR_IP>:9002&debug=1
This swfcat will also connect to the Cirrus server to obtain a client ID,
and then it will ping the facilitator to check if there are any registered
client IDs. If there is one, it will open a RTMFP connection (coordinated
by the Cirrus server) to the client and an additional connection to a 
Tor relay.

Back on the client, start Tor with the following configuration:
	UseBridges 1
	Bridge 127.0.0.1:9001
	Socks4Proxy 127.0.0.1:9001

If you see messages like
	[notice] Bootstrapped 10%: Finishing handshake with directory server.
	[notice] no known bridge descriptors running yet; stalling
try deleting the files in ~/.tor or /var/lib/tor.

You will be able to see byte counts flowing in both browsers displaying
swfcat.swf (client and proxy), and eventually be able to build a circuit.

== Rationale

The purpose of this project is to create many, generally ephemeral
bridge IP addresses, with the goal of outpacing a censor's ability to
block them. Rather than increasing the number of bridges at static
addresses, we aim to make existing bridges reachable by a larger and
changing pool of addresses.

== Design notes

Any Tor relay can be used, as long as it also serves a crossdomain
policy.

Clients register with the facilitator by sending an HTTP message:
	POST / HTTP/1.0\r\n
	\r\n
	client=<CIRRUS-CLIENT-ID>
The Flash proxy also gets a client address over HTTP:
	GET / HTTP/1.0\r\n
	\r\n
The server sends back address specifications of a client and a relay in
an HTTP respose.
	HTTP/1.0 200 OK\r\n
	Server: BaseHTTP/0.3 Python/2.5.2\r\n
	\r\n
	client=<CIRRUS-CLIENT-ID>&relay=9.9.9.9:9001
