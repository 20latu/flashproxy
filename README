Install the Flex SDK and put its bin directory in your PATH.

To build, run

$ make

Copy the swfcat.swf file to a web server.

Both the Tor client and the Tor relay (whose address is hardcoded in
swfcat.as) must serve a crossdomain policy in order to accept Flash
connections. The crossdomaind.py program does this.

On the client, set up a server to shuttle data between the Flash
connection and the local Tor. At the moment we use Ncat for this.

$ ncat -lv --max-conns 2 --broker 9001

Visit the swfcat.swf file in a web browser, appending the query string
"?client=X.X.X.X:9001", where X.X.X.X is the client address.

Then, start Tor on the client, with this configuration:

UseBridges 1
Bridge 127.0.0.1:9001

To start the facilitator on address ADDR and port PORT:
./facilitator.py ADDR PORT

The facilitator acts like an HTTP server. For a client to register
with the facilitator, they send an HTTP POST request to the server
like this:

POST / HTTP/1.0

client=192.168.0.102:8888

Sending an HTTP GET request gets a client from a server like this:

to the server:
GET / HTTP/1.0

from the server:
192.168.0.102:8888
