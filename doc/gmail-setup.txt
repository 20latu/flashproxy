These are instructions for setting up a Gmail account for use with the
email-based rendezvous and flashproxy-reg-email. These instructions were
current as of October 2012.

You may have trouble if you are using Tor to create the account, for two
reasons. The first is that exit nodes are a source of abuse and Google
is more suspicious of them. The second is that Gmail is suspicious and
can lock you out of the account when your IP address is changing. While
setting up the account, use a single node in your torrc ExitNodes
configuration. Choose a U.S. exit node, one with low bandwidth.

Go to https://mail.google.com/. Allow JavaScript to run (even from
youtube.com; it seems to be necessary). Click the "CREATE AN ACCOUNT"
button.

Enter the account details. You don't need to fill in "Your current email
address". Enter a mobile phone number for later activation of two-factor
authentication. Solve the captcha. Click "Next Step". You may have to do
a phone SMS verification here.

At this point the Gmail account is created. If you are pushed into
joining Google+, close everything out and go back to
https://mail.google.com/.

Log out of the account and then back in again. There will be new text in
the lower right reading "Last account activity". Click "Details" and
turn off the unusual activity alerts. This will keep you from getting
locked out when you come from different IP addresses. At this point you
should remove the temporary ExitNodes configuration from torrc.

Add a filter to prevent registrations from being marked as spam. Click
on the gear icon and select "Settings". Select "Filters" then "Create a
new filter". For "Has the words" type "in:spam", then "Create filter
with this search". There will be a warning that filters using "in:" will
never match incoming mail; this appears to be false and you can just
click OK. Check "Never send it to Spam" and click "Create filter".

Enable IMAP. Click the gear icon, then "Settings", then "Forwarding and
POP/IMAP".
	* Disable POP
	* Enable IMAP
	* Auto-Expunge on
Click "Save Changes".
