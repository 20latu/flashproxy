FLASHPROXY-CLIENT(1)
====================

NAME
----
flashproxy-client - The Flashproxy pluggable transport client program

SYNOPSIS
--------
**flashproxy-client** **--register** [__OPTIONS__] [__LOCAL__][:__PORT__] [__REMOTE__][:__PORT__]

DESCRIPTION
-----------
Wait for connections on a local and a remote port. When any pair of connections
exists, data is ferried between them until one side is closed. By default
__LOCAL__ is localhost addresses on port 9001 and __REMOTE__ is all addresses
on port 9000.

The local connection acts as a SOCKS4a proxy, but the host and port in the SOCKS
request are ignored and the local connection is always linked to a remote
connection.

By default, runs as a managed proxy: informs a parent Tor project of support for
the "websocket" pluggable transport. In managed mode, the __LOCAL__ port is chosen
arbitrarily instead of defaulting to 9001; however this can be
overridden by including a __LOCAL__ port in the command. This is the way the
program should be invoked in a torrc ClientTransportPlugin "exec" line.
Use the --external option to run as an external proxy that does not
interact with Tor.

If any of the **--register**, **--register-addr**, or **--register-methods** options are
used, then your IP address will be sent to the facilitator so that proxies can
connect to you. You need to register in some way in order to get any service.
The **--facilitator** option allows controlling which facilitator is used; if
omitted, it uses a public default.

OPTIONS
-------

**--daemon**::
    Daemonize (Unix only).

**--external**::
    Be an external proxy (don't interact with Tor using environment variables
    and stdout).

**-f**, **--facilitator**=__URL__::
    Advertise willingness to receive connections to URL.

**-h**, **--help**::
    Display a help message and exit.

**-l**, **--log** __FILENAME__::
    Write log to __FILENAME__ (default is stdout).

**--pidfile** __FILENAME__::
    Write PID to __FILENAME__ after daemonizing.

**-r**, **--register**::
    Register with the facilitator.

**--register-addr**=__ADDR__::
    Register the given address (in case it differs from REMOTE). Implies --register.

**--register-methods**=__METHOD__[,__METHOD__]::
    register using the given comma-separated list of methods. Implies --register. 
    Possible methods are: email, http. Default is "email,http".

**--unsafe-logging**::
    Don't scrub IP addresses from logs.
