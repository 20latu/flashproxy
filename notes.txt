== Things to do

Try tor-fw-helper for NAT traversal.

Limit rate of registration in facilitator, maybe just one reg per IP.

We need to solve the problem of potential changing fingerprints when
reconnecting through a new proxy. Tor remembers the host fingerprint
from the first connection (to the bridge it thinks is at 127.0.0.1) and
balks at connecting to the same address with a different fingerprint.
