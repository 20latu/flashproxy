== Things to do

Try tor-fw-helper for NAT traversal.

Limit rate of registration in facilitator, maybe just one reg per IP.

We need to solve the problem of potential changing fingerprints when
reconnecting through a new proxy. Tor remembers the host fingerprint
from the first connection (to the bridge it thinks is at 127.0.0.1) and
balks at connecting to the same address with a different fingerprint.

== How to use with an SSH proxy

Start swfcat, giving it a relay parameter pointing to your SSH server.
	http://example.com/swfcat.swf?facilitator=<facilitator_addr>:<facilitator_port>&relay=<ssh_addr>:<ssh_port>
Start the connector.
	python connector.py -f <facilitator_addr:facilitator_port>
Start SSH, giving it a proxy command to connect through the connector.
	ssh -v -N -D 1080 <ssh_addr> -p <ssh_port> \
	    -o 'ProxyCommand=socat - SOCKS4A:localhost:dummy:0,socksport=9001'
