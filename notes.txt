== Things to do

Bandwidth rate limiting in swfcat.

Limit rate of registration in facilitator, maybe just one reg per IP.

We need to solve the problem of potential changing fingerprints when
reconnecting through a new proxy. Tor remembers the host fingerprint
from the first connection (to the bridge it thinks is at 127.0.0.1) and
balks at connecting to the same address with a different fingerprint.

Could be useful to have a swfcatsim.py program. This would simulate
a swfcat instance (perhaps without the crossdomain stuff), providing
a bridge with a lifetime randomly chosen from some distribution. (For
example: "simulate proxies connecting according to this Poisson
distribution and staying connected according to this exponential
distribution.")
