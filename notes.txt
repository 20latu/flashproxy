Bandwidth rate limiting in swfcat.

Limit rate of registration in facilitator, maybe just one reg per IP.

Could be useful to have a swfcatsim.py program. This would simulate
a swfcat instance (perhaps without the crossdomain stuff), providing
a bridge with a lifetime randomly chosen from some distribution. (For
example: "simulate proxies connecting according to this Poisson
distribution and staying connected according to this exponential
distribution.")
